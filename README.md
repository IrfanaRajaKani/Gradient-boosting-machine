# Gradient-boosting-machine
# Overview
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in an iterative fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function

# Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived the disaster. 

We have two datas in the Tictanic dataset
1.test.csv
2.train.csv
This dataset contains the "**Passengers details**" with the following attributes:
-`PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger
- `Survived`:Survival status (0=No,1=Yes).
- `pclass`:Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- `Name`: Name of the passenger.
- `Sex`: Gender of the passenger.
- `Age`:Age of the passenger.
- `Sibsp`:Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard.
- `Ticket`: Ticket number.
- `Fare`: Passenger fare.
- `Cabin`: Cabin number.
-----
# Methodology
**Data preprocessing**
- **Handling Missing Values**: Impute missing values for features like age and embarked location.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables (e.g., sex, embarked) into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
- **Dropping Irrelevant Features:** Remove features that do not contribute to the prediction (e.g., passenger ID, name, ticket number, cabin).
**Data spliting**:Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
  - **Model Training**
  - **Initialize the GBM Model**: Set hyperparameters such as the number of boosting stages, learning rate, and maximum depth of trees.
  - **Train the Model**: Fit the GBM model to the training data.

# Overfitting
It is always good to pay attention to the potential of overfitting, but certain algorithms and certain implementations are more prone to this issue. For example, when using Deep Neural Nets and Gradient Boosting Machines, it's always a good idea to check for overfitting.

# Software
**
For each algorithm, we will provide examples of open source R packages that implement the algorithm. All implementations are different, so we will provide information on how each of the implementations differ.

# Key Insights 
- `Model Effectiveness`: GBM achieved high predictive accuracy in predicting Titanic passenger survival.
- `Important Features`: Key features like passenger class, gender, and age significantly influenced survival predictions.
- `Handling Missing Data`: Proper imputation of missing values improved model performance.
- `Hyperparameter Tuning`: Careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and number of trees enhanced accuracy.
- `Model Comparison`: GBM outperformed other models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forests.
- `Visualization`: Feature importance and performance metrics helped understand the model's decision-making process.

# Conclusion

In this project, we successfully utilized Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the Titanic dataset. By following a systematic methodology, we performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to develop a robust predictive model.
